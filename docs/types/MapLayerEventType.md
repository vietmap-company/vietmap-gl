# Type alias: MapLayerEventType

Æ¬ **MapLayerEventType**: `Object`

`MapLayerEventType` - a mapping between the event name and the event.
**Note:** These events are compatible with the optional `layerId` parameter.
If `layerId` is included as the second argument in [Map#on](../classes/Map.md#on), the event listener will fire only when the
event action contains a visible portion of the specified layer.
The following example can be used for all the events.

**`Example`**

```ts
// Initialize the map
let map = new Map({ // map options });
// Set an event listener for a specific layer
map.on('the-event-name', 'poi-label', function(e) {
  console.log('An event has occurred on a visible portion of the poi-label layer');
});
```

| Name | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `click` | [`MapLayerMouseEvent`](MapLayerMouseEvent.md) | Fired when a pointing device (usually a mouse) is pressed and released contains a visible portion of the specified layer. **`See`** - [Measure distances] - [Center the map on a clicked symbol](https://maps.vietmap.vn/docs/sdk-web-gl/marker/example-marker/cluster-marker/) |
| `contextmenu` | [`MapLayerMouseEvent`](MapLayerMouseEvent.md) | Fired when the right button of the mouse is clicked or the context menu key is pressed within visible portion of the specified layer. |
| `dblclick` | [`MapLayerMouseEvent`](MapLayerMouseEvent.md) | Fired when a pointing device (usually a mouse) is pressed and released twice contains a visible portion of the specified layer. **Note:** Under normal conditions, this event will be preceded by two `click` events. |
| `mousedown` | [`MapLayerMouseEvent`](MapLayerMouseEvent.md) | Fired when a pointing device (usually a mouse) is pressed while inside a visible portion of the specified layer. **`See`** [Create a draggable point](https://maps.vietmap.vn/docs/sdk-web-gl/marker/example-marker/draggable-marker/) |
| `mouseenter` | [`MapLayerMouseEvent`](MapLayerMouseEvent.md) | Fired when a pointing device (usually a mouse) enters a visible portion of a specified layer from outside that layer or outside the map canvas. **`See`** - [Center the map on a clicked symbol](https://maps.vietmap.vn/docs/sdk-web-gl/marker/example-marker/cluster-marker/) - [Display a popup on click](https://maps.vietmap.vn/docs/sdk-web-gl/popup/example-popup/popup-marker/) |
| `mouseleave` | [`MapLayerMouseEvent`](MapLayerMouseEvent.md) | Fired when a pointing device (usually a mouse) leaves a visible portion of a specified layer, or leaves the map canvas. **`See`** - [Highlight features under the mouse pointer] - [Display a popup on click](https://maps.vietmap.vn/docs/sdk-web-gl/popup/example-popup/popup-marker/) |
| `mousemove` | [`MapLayerMouseEvent`](MapLayerMouseEvent.md) | Fired when a pointing device (usually a mouse) is moved while the cursor is inside a visible portion of the specified layer. As you move the cursor across the layer, the event will fire every time the cursor changes position within that layer. **`See`** - [Get coordinates of the mouse pointer] - [Highlight features under the mouse pointer] - [Display a popup on over](https://maps.vietmap.vn/docs/sdk-web-gl/popup/example-popup/popup-hover/) |
| `mouseout` | [`MapLayerMouseEvent`](MapLayerMouseEvent.md) | Fired when a point device (usually a mouse) leaves the visible portion of the specified layer. |
| `mouseover` | [`MapLayerMouseEvent`](MapLayerMouseEvent.md) | Fired when a pointing device (usually a mouse) is moved inside a visible portion of the specified layer. **`See`** - [Get coordinates of the mouse pointer] - [Highlight features under the mouse pointer] - [Display a popup on hover](https://maps.vietmap.vn/docs/sdk-web-gl/popup/example-popup/popup-hover/) |
| `mouseup` | [`MapLayerMouseEvent`](MapLayerMouseEvent.md) | Fired when a pointing device (usually a mouse) is released while inside a visible portion of the specified layer. **`See`** [Create a draggable point](https://maps.vietmap.vn/docs/sdk-web-gl/marker/example-marker/draggable-marker/) |
| `touchcancel` | [`MapLayerTouchEvent`](MapLayerTouchEvent.md) | Fired when a [`touchstart`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/touchstart) event occurs within the visible portion of the specified layer. **`See`** [Create a draggable point](https://maps.vietmap.vn/docs/sdk-web-gl/marker/example-marker/draggable-marker/) |
| `touchend` | [`MapLayerTouchEvent`](MapLayerTouchEvent.md) | Fired when a [`touchend`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/touchend) event occurs within the visible portion of the specified layer. **`See`** [Create a draggable point](https://maps.vietmap.vn/docs/sdk-web-gl/marker/example-marker/draggable-marker/) |
| `touchstart` | [`MapLayerTouchEvent`](MapLayerTouchEvent.md) | Fired when a [`touchstart`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/touchstart) event occurs within the visible portion of the specified layer. **`See`** [Create a draggable point](https://maps.vietmap.vn/docs/sdk-web-gl/marker/example-marker/draggable-marker/) |
