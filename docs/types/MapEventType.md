# Type alias: MapEventType

Æ¬ **MapEventType**: `Object`

`MapEventType` - a mapping between the event name and the event value.
These events are used with the [Map#on](../classes/Map.md#on) method.
When using a `layerId` with [Map#on](../classes/Map.md#on) method, please refer to [MapLayerEventType](MapLayerEventType.md).
The following example can be used for all the events.

**`Example`**

```ts
// Initialize the map
let map = new Map({ // map options });
// Set an event listener
map.on('the-event-name', () => {
  console.log('An event has occurred!');
});
```

| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `boxzoomcancel` | [`VietMapZoomEvent`](VietMapZoomEvent.md) | Fired when the user cancels a "box zoom" interaction, or when the bounding box does not meet the minimum size threshold. See [BoxZoomHandler](../classes/BoxZoomHandler.md). |
| `boxzoomend` | [`VietMapZoomEvent`](VietMapZoomEvent.md) | Fired when a "box zoom" interaction ends. See [BoxZoomHandler](../classes/BoxZoomHandler.md). |
| `boxzoomstart` | [`VietMapZoomEvent`](VietMapZoomEvent.md) | Fired when a "box zoom" interaction starts. See [BoxZoomHandler](../classes/BoxZoomHandler.md). |
| `click` | [`MapMouseEvent`](../classes/MapMouseEvent.md) | Fired when a pointing device (usually a mouse) is pressed and released at the same point on the map. **`See`** - [Measure distances] - [Center the map on a clicked symbol](https://maps.vietmap.vn/docs/sdk-web-gl/marker/example-marker/cluster-marker/) |
| `contextmenu` | [`MapMouseEvent`](../classes/MapMouseEvent.md) | Fired when the right button of the mouse is clicked or the context menu key is pressed within the map. |
| `data` | [`MapDataEvent`](MapDataEvent.md) | Fired when any map data loads or changes. See [MapDataEvent](MapDataEvent.md) for more information. **`See`** [Display HTML clusters with custom properties](https://maps.vietmap.vn/docs/sdk-web-gl/marker/example-marker/cluster-marker/) |
| `dataabort` | [`MapDataEvent`](MapDataEvent.md) | Fired when a request for one of the map's sources' tiles or data is aborted. |
| `dataloading` | [`MapDataEvent`](MapDataEvent.md) | Fired when any map data (style, source, tile, etc) begins loading or changing asynchronously. All `dataloading` events are followed by a `data`, `dataabort` or `error` event. |
| `dblclick` | [`MapMouseEvent`](../classes/MapMouseEvent.md) | Fired when a pointing device (usually a mouse) is pressed and released twice at the same point on the map in rapid succession. **Note:** Under normal conditions, this event will be preceded by two `click` events. |
| `drag` | [`VietMapEvent`](VietMapEvent.md)\<`MouseEvent` \| `TouchEvent` \| `undefined`\> | Fired repeatedly during a "drag to pan" interaction. See [DragPanHandler](../classes/DragPanHandler.md). |

| `mousemove` | [`MapMouseEvent`](../classes/MapMouseEvent.md) | Fired when a pointing device (usually a mouse) is moved while the cursor is inside the map.
